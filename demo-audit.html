            <h3>A. The "Patent Obituary"</h3>
            <div class="visual-placeholder">
                <p style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold; color: var(--text-primary);">ü™¶</p>
                <p><strong>Patent Concept:</strong> "Slide to Unlock Gesture" (Based on US7657849B2)</p>
                <p><strong>Current Status:</strong> Expired / Widely Superseded</p>
                <p><strong>Estimated Historical Value (Peak):</strong> $XXX Million+ (High Litigation/Licensing Activity)</p>
                <p><strong>Current Market Value:</strong> ~$0 (Primarily Prior Art)</p>
                <p style="color: var(--success); margin-top: 10px;"><em>Legacy Impact: Defined early smartphone interaction paradigms.</em></p>
            </div>
            <p>This iconic patent, while revolutionary during the initial smartphone boom, has reached the end of its enforceable life. Its primary value now lies in its status as well-known prior art, influencing subsequent UI design but offering no direct monetization potential.</p>

             <h4>Estimated Historical Licensing Revenue / Litigation Leverage (Hypothetical):</h4>
             <ul>
                 <li>Early Smartphone Era (2007-2012): Significant strategic value. Likely generated substantial leverage in licensing negotiations or settlements, potentially equivalent to <strong>$ Tens to Hundreds of Millions</strong> in value/cost avoidance for competitors.</li>
                 <li>Mid-Life (2013-2017): Value diminished due to alternative designs (e.g., pattern unlock, PIN) and successful legal challenges questioning novelty/obviousness in some jurisdictions.</li>
             </ul>
             <h4>Top 3 Companies That Engaged With This Concept (Historically):</h4>
             <ol>
                 <li><strong>Samsung:</strong> Key defendant in major patent litigation involving this and related UI patents. Outcome significantly impacted market dynamics.</li>
                 <li><strong>Google (Android):</strong> Actively developed and promoted alternative unlock methods, partly as a defensive strategy against such patents.</li>
                 <li><strong>HTC / Motorola / Others:</strong> Early Android implementers who faced direct or indirect pressure from this patent family.</li>

        <!-- Audit Section 3: Threat Matrix -->
        <section class="audit-section">
            <h3>C. The "Future-Proof" Threat Matrix</h3>
            <h4>Infringement Risk / Enforcement Potential (Historically):</h4>
            <p>Extremely high during its enforceable period. Apple actively pursued litigation globally, demonstrating perceived infringement by major players. Cease-and-desist letters and licensing demands were likely widespread.</p>
             <h4>Obsolescence Prediction (AI Analysis of Tech Trends 2007-2020):</h4>
             <ul>
                 <li><strong>Biometric Security (Fingerprint ~2013, Face ID ~2017):</strong> Identified as primary displacement threat. Offered superior security and convenience, reducing reliance on manual gestures. Predicted mainstream adoption within 3-5 years of introduction.</li>
                 <li><strong>Alternative Gestures (Pattern Unlock, PIN/Password improvements):</strong> Identified as secondary competitive pressure, offering users choice and reducing dependency on a single patented method.</li>
                 <li><strong>Contextual Unlocking (Smartwatches, Trusted Locations ~2015+):</strong> Reduced the frequency of lock screen interaction, further diminishing the core gesture's necessity.</li>
             </ul>
             <p><strong>AI Analysis indicates:</strong> Core utility significantly eroded by 2016-2018 due to the confluence of biometric adoption and alternative software solutions.</p>

        <!-- Audit Section 4: Verdict -->
        <section class="audit-section">
            <h3>D. The "Goldmine or Landmine?" Verdict</h3>
             <p class="score score-low">8 / 100 (Current Commercial Relevance)</p>
             <p class="verdict-text">
                 A historical <strong>Goldmine</strong> that shaped an industry, but now commercially irrelevant for licensing or direct enforcement. It is a textbook example of a high-impact patent reaching obsolescence due to rapid technological evolution. Valuable only as prior art or a historical case study.
